    <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Created for CS488 (Introduction to Computer Graphics) during Fall 2011 at the University of Waterloo as a final project.  This marks the second
      time that I've taken this course.  Against all odds, I somehow managed to miss the exam during my first course attempt, and was assigned a Fail outright.  I'm pleased to announce
      that I have since passed this wonderfully fun course!
    </p>
    <p>
      The focus was on procedural generation, completely framework free code.  It was primarily an exploration in real-time interactive graphics, utilizing only shaders and
      modern graphics techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not meet all of the objectives I set for myself, but I was able to explore: texture mapping, texture atlasing, bump mapping, procedural terrain, water reflections,
      animations using Catmull-Rom splines, Phong shading/lighting model, WebGL, OpenGL ES 2.0, AI pathfinding, Perlin noise, and context-free trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I get the time, I'd like to explore more of the objectives I wasn't able to achieve, probably separate from this project.  I've put in a bit of work to polish
      certain aspects (namely, the character animation and interleaving the terrain data), but haven't had time to commit the changes yet.
